# Recipe Images

This directory will contain all recipe images for the Tasty Trends application.

## Naming Convention

- Images should be named after the recipe in kebab-case (e.g., `masala-dosa.jpg`)
- Use high-quality images with a 4:3 aspect ratio (recommended 1200x900px)
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP (WebP recommended for better performance)

## Adding Images

When adding images to this directory, make sure to update the import references in `src/lib/mockData.ts` to point to the correct image files.
